# Cognitive decline  predictor using Meta-Learning Algorithms: Project Overview

Empowering early dementia detection through personalized AI analysis of MRI scans and medical data.

* Maximized dementia prediction accuracy with Bagging, Stacking, and Boosting techniques.
* Tripled detection power: Random Forest bagging, stacked Decision Trees-Naive Bayes-KNN, and XGBoost boosting.
* Boosted prediction performance with ensembles: Bagging, Stacking, and XGBoost.

* Performed various Data Preprocessing techniques such as missing data imputation and removal of multicolinear features to clean and make the data ready for model building

* **Tuned hyperparameters** of the model to achieve best performance.

* Boosting had an accuracy of 86.76%, f1-score of 83.64% and recall of 85.19%
